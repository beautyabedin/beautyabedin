  Before starting the data analysis I spent some time to data cleaning to get more understandable data - I use Ms Excel to remove duplicate data , deal with unstructured data, detect outlier and remove it if required, handel some missing data and filter some data, summarized data to more visualizations to better understand the data.
After that I use some Excel function, mathematical and statistical function, pivot table to get required data, I create some graphs like Bar grapes, Column grapes to get more visualized data.

### Skills:
Data cleaning, Excel funtion, Mathematical and Statistical function, *Pivot table* to get required data, I create some graphs like *Bar grapes*, *Column grapes* to get more visualized data.
